        Hi! My name is Jerry and I am a recent graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I majored in mechanical engineering and will be going to grad school
        also at UMass Amherst with a concentration in offshore wind energy. In Spring 2019, I studied abroad in Malaysia and traveled all over Asia, so let me know if you
        want to chat about traveling! I was also in a club where we perform using diabolos, or chinese yoyos. Looking forward to meeting everyone!

        <!-- talk about photography and videography, show best photos -->
        Taking amazing photos/videos and editing them together is my main hobby! I often bring my camera around whenever I am out hiking with people and regularly
        edit the photos or videos for practice. Recently I have been interested in portrait photography and have been practicing it. Having an art-related hobby
        helps me take my mind off of engineering and seeing the results is really satisfying. I also own a drone for aerial shots!

        <!-- short description of myself like what I'm doing rn -->
        Currently, I am interning at a small engineering company where we sign contracts with large government organizations such as NASA and the Navy. In my own free time,
        I like to cook various dishes, spend time with friends, and experience something new. In terms of TV shows, Silicon Valley is my favorite and recently I have been
        watching the new Marvel series, Loki.

<!-- Why web developer? -->
<h2 class="titles">Why Web Developer?</h2>

    <p>
        I've always been curious how programs work while playing games, and when I first learned some basic concepts such as conditionals and loops through MATLAB,
        it sparked an interest in me. I have tried to learn programming with Java before the basic concepts but the shear amount of information overwhelmed me.
        Hopefully this focusing on this course and the projects will help me learn the concepts better!
